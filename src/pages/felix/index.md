## Installation

| package    | installation command  | notes                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| crates.io  | `cargo install felix` | Minimum Supported rustc Version: **1.78.0**                                                                                                 |
| Arch Linux | `pacman -S felix-rs`  | The binary name is `felix` if you install via pacman. Alias `fx='felix'` if you want, as this document (and other installations) uses `fx`. |
| NetBSD     | `pkgin install felix` |                                                                                                                                             |

### From git repository

- Make sure that `gcc` is installed.
- MSRV(Minimum Supported rustc Version): **1.78.0**

Update Rust if rustc < 1.78.0:

```
rustup update
```

```
git clone https://github.com/kyoheiu/felix.git
cd felix
cargo install --path .
```

<a id="integrations"></a>

### Integrations

#### Exit to last working directory (LWD)

To export your LWD to the calling shell after exiting from `fx`, add the
following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` or an equivalent depending on your
(POSIX) shell.\
_**Assuming the `fx` binary can be found in your `PATH`.**_

```sh
source <(command fx --init)
```

_If this is not set, exiting to LWD will fail and show the error message._

#### Others

In addition, you can use felix more conveniently by installing the following apps:

- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide): A smarter `cd` command, which
  enables you to jump to a directory that matches the keyword in felix.
- [chafa](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/): Terminal graphics for the 21st century,
  by which you can preview images in felix. **_chafa must be v1.10.0 or
  later._**
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A _cat(1)_ clone. Add syntax highlighting to the text preview with bat.

These apps do not need any configuration to use with felix!

<a id="usage"></a>

## Usage

_If you install this app via pacman, the default binary name is `felix`._

```
`fx` => Show items in the current directory.
`fx <directory path>` => Show items in the directory.
Both relative and absolute path available.
```

### Options

```
`--help` | `-h` => Print help.
`--log`  | `-l` => Launch the app, automatically generating a log file in `{data_local_dir}/felix/log`.
`--init`        => Returns a shell script that can be sourced for shell integration.
```

| `z {keyword}<CR>`        | **_This command requires zoxide installed._** Jump to a directory that matches the keyword.

Note that items moved to the trash directory are prefixed with Unix time (like
`1633843993`) to avoid the name conflict. This prefix will be removed when put.

## Configuration

### Config file

If any config file is not found, or found one is broken, felix launches with the
default configuration, without creating new one.\
Note that the default editor is `$EDITOR`, so if you've not set it and do not have the config file, opening a
file will fail.

_Both `config.yaml` and `config.yml` work from v2.7.0_

### Trash directory and log file

Contrary to the config file, these directory and file will be automatically created.

### Linux

```
config file     : $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/felix/config.yaml(config.yml)
trash directory : $XDG_DATA_HOME/felix/Trash
log files       : $XDG_DATA_HOME/felix/log
```

### macOS

On macOS, felix looks for the config file in the following locations:

1. `$HOME/Library/Application Support/felix/config.yaml(config.yml)`
2. `$HOME/.config/felix/config.yaml(config.yml)`

```
trash directory : $HOME/Library/Application Support/felix/Trash
log files       : $HOME/Library/Application Support/felix/log
```

### Windows

```
config file     : $PROFILE\AppData\Roaming\felix\config.yaml(config.yml)
trash directory : $PROFILE\AppData\Local\felix\Trash
log files       : $PROFILE\AppData\Local\felix\log
```

### Default config

```
# Default exec command when opening file.
# If not set, will default to $EDITOR.
# default: nvim

# Whether to match the behavior of Vim's exit keybindings.
# false -> `ZZ` exits without `cd` to LWD(Last Working Directory) While `ZQ` to LWD
# true  -> vice versa
# If not set, will default to false.
# match_vim_exit_behavior: false

# key (the command you want to use when opening file): [values] (extensions)
# In the key, You can use arguments.
# exec:
#   zathura:
#     [pdf]
#  'feh -.':
#   [jpg, jpeg, png, gif, svg, hdr]

# The foreground color of directory, file and symlink.
# Pick one of the following:
#     Black            // 0
#     Red              // 1
#     Green            // 2
#     Yellow           // 3
#     Blue             // 4
#     Magenta          // 5
#     Cyan             // 6
#     White            // 7
#     LightBlack       // 8
#     LightRed         // 9
#     LightGreen       // 10
#     LightYellow      // 11
#     LightBlue        // 12
#     LightMagenta     // 13
#     LightCyan        // 14
#     LightWhite       // 15
#     Rgb(u8, u8, u8)
#     AnsiValue(u8)
# Default to LightCyan(dir), LightWhite(file), LightYellow(symlink) and Red(changed/untracked files in git repositories).
# color:
#   dir_fg: LightCyan
#   file_fg: LightWhite
#   symlink_fg: LightYellow
#   dirty_fg: Red
```

### Command settings

For example, If you write

```
default: nvim

exec:
  'feh -.':
    [jpg, jpeg, png, gif, svg]
  zathura:
    [pdf]
```

then, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif` and `.svg` files are opened by
`feh -. <file-name>`, `.pdf` files by `zathura <file-name>` and others by
`nvim <file-name>` .

### About `Rgb` and `AnsiValue`

You can configure these colors like this:

```
color:
  dir_fg: LightCyan
  file_fg: !AnsiValue 120
  symlink_fg: LightYellow
  dirty_fg: !Rgb [124, 30, 40]
```
